# Create Binding

The Broker API allows you to create a binding to an exchange or queue on the RabbitMQ broker. To do so is pretty simple with HareDu 2. You can do it yourself or the DI way.

**Do It Yourself**

for creating exchange to exchange bindings...
```c#
var result = await new BrokerObjectFactory(config)
    .Object<Binding>()
    .Create("source_exchange", "destination_exchange", BindingType.Exchange, "vhost", "binding_key");
```

<br>

**Autofac**

```c#
var result = await _container.Resolve<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
    .Object<Binding>()
    .Create("source_exchange", "destination_exchange", BindingType.Exchange, "vhost", "binding_key");
```
<br>

**Microsoft DI**

```c#
var result = await _services.GetService<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
    .Object<Binding>()
    .Create("source_exchange", "destination_exchange", BindingType.Exchange, "vhost", "binding_key");
```
<br>

The above examples show how you would bind a source exchange to a destination exchange. However, RabbitMQ allows you to bind an exchange to a queue. In this scenario, you would set the exchange as the source and the destination as the queue like so...

```c#
var result = await new BrokerObjectFactory(config)
    .Object<Binding>()
    .Create("source_exchange", "destination_queue", BindingType.Queue, "vhost", "binding_key");
```
<br>

If you want to add adhoc arguments to the binding then you just need to call the ```Add``` method like so...

```c#
x =>
{
    x.Add("arg", "value");
};
```
<br>

A complete example would look something like this...

```c#
var result = await _services.GetService<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
    .Object<Binding>()
    .Create("source_exchange", "destination_queue", BindingType.Queue, "vhost", "*.", x =>
    {
        x.Add("arg", "value");
    });
```

<br>

The other way to create a binding is to call the extension methods off of ```IBrokerObjectFactory``` like so...

```c#
var result = await _services.GetService<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
    .CreateExchangeBinding("source_exchange", "destination_exchange", "vhost");
```
or...

```c#
var result = await _services.GetService<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
    .CreateExchangeBindingToQueue("source_exchange", "destination_queue", "vhost");
```


*Please note that subsequent calls to any of the above methods will result in overriding the argument.*
