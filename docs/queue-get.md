# Getting Queues

The Broker API allows you to get all queues on the RabbitMQ broker. To do so is pretty simple with HareDu 2. You can do it yourself or the IoC way.

**Do It Yourself**

```csharp
var result = await new BrokerObjectFactory(config)
                .Object<Queue>()
                .GetAll();
```
<br>

**Autofac**

```csharp
var result = await _container.Resolve<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
                .Object<Queue>()
                .GetAll();
```
<br>

**.NET Core DI**

```csharp
var result = await _services.GetService<IBrokerObjectFactory>()
                .Object<Queue>()
                .GetAll();
```

All examples in this document assumes the broker has been configured. If you want to know how then go to the Configuration documentation [here](https://github.com/ahives/HareDu2/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) .
